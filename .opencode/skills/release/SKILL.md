## Purpose

Release a new version of battery-optimizer with the release script and the CI pipeline.

## When to use

- The user asks to release, cut a release, publish, or tag a new version.

## How a release works

1. `make release` (`.ci/release.sh`) bumps `[project] version` in `pyproject.toml` with
   `uv version`, refreshes `uv.lock`, prepends the new section to `CHANGELOG.md` with git-cliff,
   commits `release: Version X.Y.Z` (signed, with `Signed-off-by`), and pushes `release/vX.Y.Z`.
2. Open a PR to `main` with the `gh pr create` command the script prints, and merge it.
3. On merge, CI does the rest automatically. **Never create tags or releases by hand.**
   - `auto-tag.yml` reads the newest version heading in `CHANGELOG.md` and pushes the signed tag
     `vX.Y.Z` if it does not exist yet.
   - `images.yml` runs on the tag: pushes `ghcr.io/pando85/battery-optimizer:X.Y.Z` (and `:X.Y`),
     attests provenance, scans the image, runs `uv build` and creates the GitHub release with the
     changelog section and the `dist/*` files attached.

## Prerequisites (the script enforces them)

- Clean working tree, on `main`, identical to `origin/main` (not ahead, not behind).
- Full clone with tags (`git fetch --unshallow` and `git fetch --tags` are done for you).
- `uv` installed (`UV="uvx uv@<version>" make release` to use another one) and signed commits
  configured in git.

## Version decision guide

Semantic Versioning. Review the commits since the last tag and take the highest bump:

```bash
git log "$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD" --oneline
```

| Bump | When |
|------|------|
| MAJOR | `!` after the type or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer; incompatible change to the CLI, the config format, the dataset/manifest schema or an environment variable |
| MINOR | `feat:` commits; new commands, options or datasets, backward compatible |
| PATCH | `fix:`, `perf:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `build(deps):` only |

While the project is `0.x`, breaking changes may bump MINOR; say so in the PR description.

## Steps

```bash
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
make release                 # prompts for the version; or: make release VERSION=0.2.0
# run the gh pr create command it prints, get the PR merged
gh run list --limit 5        # watch auto-tag, then the Images run on the new tag
```

The first release (`0.1.0`) uses the version already in `pyproject.toml`: pass `0.1.0` and the
script only regenerates the changelog.

## What NOT to do

| Mistake | Why it is wrong | Fix |
|---------|-----------------|-----|
| Editing `CHANGELOG.md` by hand | git-cliff generates it from conventional commits | Fix the commit message convention, run `make update-changelog` |
| Editing the version in `pyproject.toml` by hand | `uv.lock` and the changelog would drift | Use `make release` |
| Creating tags manually | `auto-tag.yml` creates the signed tag | Merge the release PR |
| Releasing from a feature branch | The changelog needs the merged `main` commit ids | `git checkout main` first |
| Passing `--no-gpg-sign` | Release commits and tags must be signed | Fix the local signing setup |

## Troubleshooting

- **"commits ahead of origin/main"**: push or merge them first.
- **Shallow clone**: `git fetch --unshallow origin && git fetch --tags origin`.
- **Auto-tag did not run**: `CHANGELOG.md` must have a `## [X.Y.Z]` heading as its first version
  entry, the tag must not exist yet (`git ls-remote --tags origin`), and the `PAT` and
  `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` repository secrets must be set. Without a version heading the job is a green
  no-op by design.
- **Tag exists but no images**: check the `Images` run for that tag; re-run it from the Actions tab.

## Key files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `pyproject.toml` | `[project] version`: single source of truth |
| `cliff.toml` | git-cliff changelog configuration |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Generated changelog; auto-tag reads the version from it |
| `.ci/release.sh` | Release branch/commit script behind `make release` |
| `.github/workflows/auto-tag.yml` | Creates the signed tag on push to `main` |
| `.github/workflows/images.yml` | Builds/pushes the image and creates the GitHub release on tags |

## Checklist

- [ ] On `main`, clean, up to date with `origin/main`
- [ ] Version bump decided from the commits since the last tag
- [ ] `make release` run, `release/vX.Y.Z` pushed
- [ ] PR opened and merged
- [ ] `auto-tag` and `Images` runs green, GitHub release present

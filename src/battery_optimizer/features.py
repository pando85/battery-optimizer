"""Slot-aligned sub-load feature table (P3 of the load-forecaster improvement plan).

The canonical dataset (``build``) carries one number per 15-minute slot: the gross load of the
whole-home meter.  This module builds a **separate** table next to it that carries the
observable parts of that load and the signals that drive them: the servers circuit, the heat
pump (heating, hot water, cooling), the measured outdoor temperature and the AppDaemon control
states.  It reads the raw Prometheus samples of the entities in :data:`SIGNALS` and never writes
into a canonical dataset directory, so a canonical ``dataset_id`` and the golden benchmark runs
are unaffected by it.

Where it lives
--------------
``<data_dir>/analysis/v1/features/<feature_set_id>/`` holds one Parquet part per build and a
``features_manifest.json`` with the hashes of every raw part that was read, the code version,
the parameters and the quality checks.  The id hashes exactly those inputs, so the same inputs
give the same id and identical bytes, and the store is write-once like the rest of the data
directory.

Integration rule (power series -> energy per slot)
--------------------------------------------------
Prometheus holds one sample per scrape (about one per minute, at irregular sub-second offsets).
A power sample is a **sample-and-hold** value: the value read at scrape time ``t_i`` is taken to
hold until the next sample ``t_{i+1}``.  The energy of a slot is the exact integral of that step
function over the slot, so a span that straddles a slot edge is split in proportion to time.

*Max-sample-gap rule.*  A span ``[t_i, t_{i+1})`` is **covered** only when
``t_{i+1} - t_i <= max_gap_seconds`` (default 300 s, five scrape intervals).  A longer span is a
gap: it contributes neither energy nor coverage.  The time after the last sample of a series is
also not covered.  Nothing is interpolated across a gap.

*Coverage and quality.*  ``<series>_coverage`` is the covered fraction of the slot (0 to 1).

* ``measured``: the whole slot is covered.
* ``partial``: coverage is at least ``min_coverage`` (default 0.8) but not complete.  The energy
  is the mean power over the covered time times the slot length, so a partly covered slot is
  scaled up to the full slot, and the quality column says so.
* ``unknown``: coverage is below ``min_coverage``.  The energy is NaN (null in the Parquet
  file), never zero.

Other signals
-------------
*Temperature* is the time-weighted mean over the covered time (NaN below ``min_coverage``).  A
*control state* has the value at slot start (``<name>_at_start``: the sample whose covered span
contains the slot start, NaN when that instant is in a gap) and the time-weighted mean over the
slot (``<name>_mean``, which is the fraction of the slot the boolean was on).  A *counter* such
as the washer plug's energy-today only has the as-of value at slot start.

Climate signal set
------------------
:data:`CLIMATE_SIGNALS` (``build-features --signal-set climate``) is a second, separate feature
set with its own id: rooms (current and target temperature of each thermostat), the heat pump's
water side, compressor frequency and starts, pump flow, heat/hot-water/cooling electric and
thermal energy, the aerothermal branch and the control states.  Two more kinds join the rules
above.  A *gauge* (frequency, flow) is the time-weighted mean like a temperature.  A
*counter delta* (compressor starts, the energy totals) is the counter's increase per slot: each
span's increase is spread over the span in proportion to time and then follows the power rule
(gaps are not covered, ``partial`` is scaled to the full slot, ``unknown`` is NaN).  A drop to
under half of the previous value is a counter reset and the span adds the value read after it;
a smaller drop is a rollback and adds nothing (see :func:`counter_rates`).

Leakage note: every feature of slot ``k`` uses samples from inside slot ``k``.  A forecaster may
use only ``*_at_start`` of the slot it forecasts, or any feature of an earlier slot.

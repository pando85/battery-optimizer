"""Battery AC energy counters and the commissioning instant, for the offline pipeline.

The offline build must know two things about the house battery that the data alone cannot
tell it: which Home Assistant entities carry the AC charge and discharge energy counters, and
from which instant the battery may exchange energy (after which the whole-home feed no longer
equals the household load).  Both live in ``config/service.yaml``, next to the entity roles the
live service already uses, so the build and the service history read one set of names:

``entities.battery_charge_energy`` / ``entities.battery_discharge_energy``
    The counters.  The exact OmniBattery entity ids are unknown until installation, so the
    committed values are ``null`` placeholders; nothing here invents an id.
``battery.commissioned_at``
    ISO-8601 instant with an explicit UTC offset, ``null`` while no battery is installed.

The file is deliberately **not** ``config/tariff.yaml``: the hash of that file is part of every
``dataset_id``, so a date recorded there would re-mint every dataset (ADR-0006, "record dates
in ``docs/planning/``, never in ``config/tariff.yaml``").  The service config is not hashed into
a dataset, and a window that ends before ``commissioned_at`` ignores this configuration
altogether (see :func:`battery_optimizer.build.build_dataset`).

The module imports nothing from the build or the extractor, so both can use it.

PVPC-aware home battery dispatch optimizer for Home Assistant. It ships an offline extraction, dataset
and benchmark pipeline ([ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-phase1-measurement-and-baseline.md)) plus a resident
**shadow** service that runs the same MPC live against read-only Home Assistant and Prometheus data
([docs/service.md](docs/service.md)). It currently runs in shadow mode only: plans are recorded and
compared with the native battery behaviour, and nothing is ever actuated.

FUTURE ACT (NOT CONNECTED): DispatchIntent -> safety guard -> HA adapter
                            -> Omnibattery PD -> Marstek Venus E
Current SOC source: simulated; real battery/Omnibattery HA entities absent.
```

**DECIDE** is decomposed into four *logical* components (not four services):
**Load Forecaster**, **Price Outlook**, **Battery Model** and **Dispatch Optimizer**.
The first three supply independent inputs to the optimizer. The battery model is
shared with simulation and backtesting; it does **not** consume the forecasts.
**Price Outlook** currently reads published PVPC prices, not predicted prices.
The shadow service uses **simulated SOC** until the battery entities are available.
There is no path to live actuation; the ACT line is a future design only.

See [planning component responsibilities](docs/architecture.md#planning-components) and the
**individual component roadmaps** for scoped improvements and acceptance gates:
[Load Forecaster](docs/planning/components/load-forecaster.md),
[Price Outlook](docs/planning/components/price-outlook.md),
[Battery Model](docs/planning/components/battery-model.md), and
[Dispatch Optimizer](docs/planning/components/dispatch-optimizer.md).

The modules, the pipeline stages and the shadow service are described in
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) and the [ADRs](docs/adr/).

## Quick start

Requires Python 3.14 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/); the development recipes also need [just](https://just.systems).

```bash
# Run from a checkout
uv sync --extra dev
uv run battery-optimizer --help

# Or install the CLI from a release
uv tool install https://github.com/pando85/battery-optimizer/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/battery_optimizer-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl
```

Or run the multi-arch container image (`ghcr.io/pando85/battery-optimizer`; tags, the `serve` example and
provenance verification are in [docs/container.md](docs/container.md)):

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/pando85/battery-optimizer:latest --help

# Mount the private data directory and the tariff config; pass secrets by name, never by value.
docker run --rm --read-only \
  -v "$HOME/data/energy-baseline:/data" \
  -v "$PWD/config:/config:ro" \
  -e BATTERY_OPTIMIZER_DATA_DIR=/data \
  -e BATTERY_OPTIMIZER_CONFIG=/config/tariff.yaml \
  -e BATTERY_OPTIMIZER_HA_TOKEN \
  ghcr.io/pando85/battery-optimizer:latest validate
```

The minimal environment:

- `BATTERY_OPTIMIZER_DATA_DIR`: private dataset store, **outside** any git worktree (default `~/data/energy-baseline`).
- `BATTERY_OPTIMIZER_CONFIG`: tariff configuration file (default `config/tariff.yaml`).
- `BATTERY_OPTIMIZER_HA_TOKEN`: read-only Home Assistant token, needed for HA extraction, `ha-states` and `serve`.

The full table, the data directory rules and the secrets policy are in
[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Usage

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `extract` | Ingest from Prometheus / HA history to Parquet |
| `validate` | Validate raw Parquet against schemas and manifest hashes |
| `build` | Build the 15-min analysis dataset |
| `benchmark` | Run the policy ladder (no battery to oracle) on a dataset |
| `report` | Generate the monthly reconciliation report |
| `inspect-sql` | Inspect DuckDB SQL queries |
| `ha-states` | Read Home Assistant enum state history (deduplicated, as-of) |
| `serve` | Resident shadow service: read-only HA/Prometheus, live MPC, intents recorded never sent |
| `shadow-report` | Shadow plans vs native battery behaviour: coverage, energy, cost, SOC violations |
| `mirror` | Deferred, not implemented in Phase 1 |

Flags, exit codes and examples: [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md) and [docs/benchmark.md](docs/benchmark.md).

## Development

just git-hooks    # install the pre-commit and commit-msg hooks (once)
just lint         # all pre-commit checks: ruff, yamllint, shellcheck, uv.lock, ...
just fmt          # ruff check --fix and ruff format
just test         # pytest
just image        # build the container image locally
```

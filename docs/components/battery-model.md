# Battery model (physics, limits, losses, wear)

## Purpose and owner

The feasible charge, discharge and state-of-charge transitions of the house battery, shared by the
benchmark, the live planner and the shadow replay. Owner: this repository (`battery.py`; assumptions
resolved by `benchmark.resolve_battery_assumptions` and `service/planner.battery_spec_from_tariff` from
the `battery:` block of `config/tariff.yaml`). Roadmap: [Battery Model](../planning/components/battery-model.md).

## Interfaces

- **In:** `config/tariff.yaml` battery block (and, after commissioning, measured SOC and counters).
- **Out:** `BatterySpec` and `Horizon`; `simulate`, `check_feasible`, `compute_efc`.
- **Consumers:** [battery-optimizer](battery-optimizer.md), [boost-mode](boost-mode.md) (interlock reads
  SOC), [system-replay-benchmark](system-replay-benchmark.md), every `dataset_id` (the tariff file is hashed).

## Calibrated on

Nothing measured: the battery (Marstek Venus E class AC unit) is bought and **not commissioned**, so there
is no telemetry. Confirmed from specification or contract: capacity 5.12 kWh nameplate, 2.5 kW AC power,
5.0 kW contracted import limit. Provisional values are in the next section. Datasets built at
`config_hash` `7a901801...` (RTE 0.80); everything computed at the earlier 0.88 is superseded.

## Assumptions

| Parameter | Value | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Round-trip efficiency | 0.80 (0.89443 per leg) | Owner choice 2026-10-24, bottom of the 0.80 to 0.84 range reported by others; a scalar, not a curve |
| SOC window | 0.20 to 0.95 (3.84 kWh usable) | Owner's life-extension choice; real controller limits not read |
| Initial SOC | 0.20 | Floor, so no free stored energy |
| Idle draw | 0, not modelled | `battery.py`; unmeasured |
| Wear / throughput cost | 0.01 EUR/kWh per AC kWh and direction (`planning.throughput_cost_eur_per_kwh`, set 2026-10-31) | Knee of the rolling-horizon sweep, see [Wear cost decision](#wear-cost-decision-2026-10-31); a planning convention, not a measured aging rate |
| Import limit | 5.0 kW; the model uses a 15-minute average with no margin, which is **insufficient** | Contract; enforced by the smart meter, which cuts supply on overload (owner-confirmed 2026-10-30, has happened); the trip is **instantaneous** (owner-confirmed 2026-10-31, no distributor document yet) |
| Export | none, no credit | Invariant of the kernel; no PV |

Evidence: [`config/tariff.yaml`](../../config/tariff.yaml), [benchmark](../benchmark.md), [ADR-0001](../adr/0001-home-battery-economic-dispatch.md).

## Invalidated when

- The battery is commissioned and a measurement disagrees with any row above (RTE vs power, idle draw,
  usable window, latency, firmware limits).
- The Omnibattery or firmware configuration changes limits; the warranty terms change the wear value.
- The wear cost is changed, or measured cycle ageing or the warranty terms disagree with it (below).
- Any edit to the battery block of `config/tariff.yaml`: every `dataset_id` is re-minted and the old
  datasets and benchmark results are superseded (record it).
- The import-limit basis turns out to be an instantaneous trip: the averaged constraint is then not a
  sufficient guard.

## Recalibrate by

1. Commissioning measurement ([roadmap BM-1, BM-2](../planning/components/battery-model.md)): synchronized
   SOC, signed AC power and energy counters; several power and SOC bands; standby draw; full and partial
   cycles. Do not infer RTE from an unbalanced partial cycle.
2. Update the battery block in `config/tariff.yaml`, rebuild datasets, supersede the old ones, re-run
   `uv run battery-optimizer benchmark ...` ([benchmark](../benchmark.md)).
3. Wear: re-run `hack/throughput_sweep.py` (command below) on new-regime data, pick the knee and set
   `planning.throughput_cost_eur_per_kwh` (a service value; no dataset re-mint).
4. Acceptance: predicted against measured Wh and SOC on held-out physical intervals, by power band;
   a model refinement is rejected if the measured gain is negligible or it breaks MILP feasibility.

## Wear cost decision (2026-10-31)

**Convention.** `tp` is EUR per AC kWh, charged and discharged each (objective `(price + tp) * charge -
(price - tp) * discharge`), so a cycle of E kWh in and 0.8 E out costs `1.8 tp E`. Planning only: it never
enters the reported cost, so the savings below are real meter-bill savings of a plan made with that `tp`.
EFC is DC discharge over the 3.84 kWh usable window; nameplate cycles are EFC x 0.75.

Rolling horizon (benchmark policy, causal load forecast), observed load, dataset `cdd448abb006`, each window
against its own `no_battery`. Saving lost is relative to `tp` 0; the saving at `tp` 0 is 13.7% (S2), 16.0%
(S3) and 15.8% (summer 2025) of no-battery cost.

| tp | S2 lost | S2 EFC/day | S3 lost | S3 EFC/day | Summer lost | Summer EFC/day |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0% | 1.16 | 0% | 1.19 | 0% | 1.06 |
| 0.005 | 0.3% | 1.04 | 0.2% | 1.09 | -0.2% | 0.97 |
| **0.01** | **2.3%** | **0.91** | **1.7%** | **0.99** | **0.8%** | **0.89** |
| 0.015 | 5.8% | 0.80 | 4.8% | 0.88 | 2.8% | 0.82 |
| 0.02 | 10.4% | 0.70 | 11.3% | 0.73 | 5.7% | 0.74 |
| 0.03 | 21.5% | 0.52 | 21.2% | 0.57 | 15.3% | 0.59 |
| 0.05 | 44.3% | 0.28 | 44.1% | 0.33 | 44.5% | 0.29 |

Windows: S2 and S3 are 2024-10-01 to 2025-04-30 and 2025-10-01 to 2026-04-30, summer 2025-05-01 to 2025-09-30.
The oracle gives the same picture (knee 0.01 in S2, 0.015 in S3 and summer); its solves at `tp` above 0 end as
time-limited incumbents at 600 s, so its savings there are lower bounds.

**Knee** (largest `tp` before the saving falls by more than 5%): 0.01 in S2, 0.015 in S3 and summer. The
setting is **0.01**, the binding (S2) value: it gives up 1 to 2% of the saving and removes 16 to 21% of the
cycling. 0.015 is past the knee in S2.

**Warranty budget.** Marstek states a 10-year warranty and a cycle life above 6000 cycles at 25 degC (80%
retention per retailers; a trade-press report gives 70% residual capacity at 10 years; not verified in the
warranty card, and no throughput cap was found). 6000 cycles in 10 years is 1.64 nameplate cycles per day.
The sweep needs at most 0.89 nameplate cycles per day at `tp` 0 and at most 0.74 at 0.01, so the cycle budget
does not bind at any value: `tp` is an economic proxy for wear, not a warranty guard. Replacement-cost
amortisation gives `tp = price / (2 x N x usable kWh)` per direction for a battery replaced after N usable
cycles with no residual value; it is an upper bound because the battery also ages with calendar time.

**Reproduce** (outputs under `<store>/analysis/v1/throughput-sweep/<run-id>/`, fresh run id each time):

```bash
uv run python hack/throughput_sweep.py --dataset <store>/analysis/v1/<dataset_id> \
  --data-dir <store> --run-id <fresh-name>
```

## Status

**provisional** (2026-10-31): RTE, SOC window and idle draw are assumptions, and the wear cost (set to 0.01) is a
planning convention to be re-checked on measured data. Idle draw must be set before go-live.
